# backdoor_restrict (c) Scott Carlson sacarlson@ipipi.com
# enable or disable rssh restricted shell on the present backdoor account
# example to restrict the backdoor account:
# backdoor_restrict enable
# default is to disable rssh shell so just run backdoor_restricted with or without parameter to disable
# be careful enableing rssh if the backdoor account is also the only sudo account on the system
# you will lock yourself out as sudo.  it can be fixed but it can be a bummer if you do.
# normaly you set rssh active or not at install time but if later you want to change it without reinstall
# we have this.
