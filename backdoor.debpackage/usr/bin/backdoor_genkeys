# backdoor key gen (c) Scott Carlson sacarlson@ipipi.com
# you must have backdoor installed on both sides with rssh mode disabled on both sides.
# also you need login to the backdoor account before you run this (sudo with root won't work)
# example sudo su backdoor <cr> backdoor_genkeys
# run this on the backdoor computer system side that can connect direct with a forward ssh conection
# after complete you will have to manualy restart the backdoor ssh on both sides to get the new keys to be used
